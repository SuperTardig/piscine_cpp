# piscine_cpp
The goal of this 42 school project is to learn C++ by doing small exercise that become more and more in-depth. This project takes us from an introduction to c++ to some more complex topics like templates, containers, iterators, etc. The project is divided in 10 submodules. In this project, we needed to use the 1998 standard library and any use of features only present in later version would result in failure. The subject of each modules is as followed:
  - Module 00: This project teaches us a lot of the basic stuff, like classes, namespaces, stdio stream, etc.
  - Module 01: This project teaches us references, memory allocation in c++ and pointer to members
  - Module 02: This project teaches us ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overload and Orthodox Canonical class form
  - Module 03: This project teaches us inheritance
  - Module 04: This project teaches us abstract class and subtype polymorphism
  - Module 05: This project teaches us exceptions
  - Module 06: This project teaches us the different cast of c++
  - Module 07: This project teaches us the basics of templates
  - Module 08: This project teaches us more in-depth about templates and the basics of containers, algorithm and iterators
  - Module 09: This project teaches us more about the STL library
## Usage
